        <section id="data-requirements">
            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>The design and future implementation of UStudy will be pivotal in streamlining the academic engagement within the UMass community, employing technology to enhance the study group coordination process. At its core, UStudy will feature a comprehensive database containing detailed information on study sessions and participant profiles. This will include specific locations for group meet-ups, detailed through addresses and virtual map integration, and individual schedules to facilitate seamless connections between students.</p>
            <p>The database will be essential, detailing available study groups with time slots and subjects offered, and accommodating user preferences and academic focuses. A key element of this database is the study group profiles, which will list the academic goals of each group, preferred study methods, and resources they frequently use, organized to aid users in finding the most suitable study partners.
            </p> <!-- we can add more if needed for diff data types-->
            <p>UStudy will thrive on dynamic student interaction, driven by user-generated content such as discussion forums, study tips, and organized group study sessions. These will not only include basic identification details like majors and courses but also extend to personalized study tactics and resource sharing, creating a living library of academic collaboration. Scheduled study sessions and impromptu meet-ups will be featured, along with descriptions, timing, and sign-up capabilities, constructing a full calendar of educational gatherings.</p>
            <p>Supportive educational materials will constitute another significant component of UStudy, hosting a variety of resources from lecture notes to practice quizzes. By integrating multimedia elements like video explanations and interactive tutorials, the platform aims to engage users and aid in the comprehension of complex topics. Linking to authoritative academic resources will ensure a rich knowledge base is at the users' fingertips.
            </p>
            <p>The monitoring of application use will be instrumental for ongoing enhancements of UStudy. Insights into user behavior, such as the frequency of logins, duration of interactions, and feedback on study groups, will guide the team in refining the platform to better suit students' evolving needs.
            </p>
            <p>In sum, the success of UStudy is contingent upon the careful accumulation, management, and deployment of detailed data, tailored to the educational environment. This will facilitate a vibrant, interconnected community of learners, empowering them with the tools and knowledge to optimize their study practices and academic success. Through UStudy, we aim to embody the synergy of technology, academia, and community engagement, offering a tailored solution to the academic challenges faced by students today.</p>

        <section id="real-world">
            <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
            <p>Our application aims to facilitate connections among students sharing the same class, enabling them to form study groups and reserve campus rooms for collaborative learning sessions. In the college setting, it can be challenging to locate peers for study groups, particularly for students dealing with anxiety or lacking strong social skills. To address this issue and promote collaborative learning, our app provides an accessible platform for students to overcome barriers and study together effortlessly. Fostering positive relationships through group study is a vital skill that transcends into professional environments. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of learning and connecting with peers in an educational setting has become more apparent than ever. Our application addresses a real-life problem and contributes to enhancing the educational experience.</p>

        <section id="integrative-experience">
            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            <p>UStudy embodies the core principles of the Integrative Experience (IE), fusing educational insights from our coursework with a hands-on project that addresses a real-world challenge at UMass. Our team draws on knowledge from the CS326 web programming course to build a platform that connects students with study groups, enhancing both their academic and personal development.<br><br>

                Central to the IE is teamwork and communication, both key to the UStudy project. By working together, we are learning to combine our skills and viewpoints to build a useful and easy-to-use platform. This work mirrors real situations where diverse teams solve complex problems and helps us get better at discussing ideas, understanding different opinions, and explaining our work to a broad audience, which are important skills for the future.<br><br>
                
                Also, UStudy is a chance to use our problem-solving and critical thinking in a setting that cuts across different areas of study. We're challenged to think about how students interact and collaborate, pushing us to apply what we've learned in class to a project that aims to have a real impact.<br><br>
                
                Finally, UStudy is about learning together. It's a chance to apply what we've learned to a big issue — helping students succeed. The project shows us how our classes connect to the outside world, and it prepares us for a life of learning and facing challenges in society.</p>

                    <p>With the education from highschool and UMass, I am experienced in java, javascript, C, C++, and SQL. I’ve completed all of my 200 level courses at UMass currently taking 326, 377(Operating Systems) and 325 (HCI). I have interest in data science and cybersecurity having work experience in the former (business intelligence, data validation). I believe my strongest skills revolve around critical thinking/problem solving while also being able to utilize diversity of thought and intrapersonal communication to effectively work in a collaborative environment. I am a huge basketball fan so for the last two years, 2 other students and I have been working on a project where we are creating our own statistical metric to grade professional and college players.</p>
